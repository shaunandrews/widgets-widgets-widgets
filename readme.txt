== Description ==

Rethinking how widgets look and work in WordPress. This plugin aims to, one day, be a part of WordPress core. Right now, this is mainly a UI prototype which doesn't actually let you save your changes.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin just like any normal WordPress plugin, by dropping the folder into your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Once you activate the plugin you'll see the new "Widgets Prototype" item under the Appearance menu.
